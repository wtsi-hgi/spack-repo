"""
Example rationale: Typical R package fetched from CRAN with standard R deps.

What this teaches:
- Set cran to the CRAN package name; version() may use md5 from CRAN.
- Use depends_on("pkg", type=("build", "run")) to scope dependency roles.
- Include non-C toolchains (rust/llvm) when upstream uses them.

  Interfaces with the 'Hugging Face' tokenizers library to provide implementations

  <https://huggingface.co/docs/tokenizers/index>. It's extremely fast for both 
  training new vocabularies and tokenizing texts.
