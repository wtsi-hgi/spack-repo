"""
Example rationale: Typical R package fetched from CRAN with standard R deps.

What this teaches:
- Set cran to the CRAN package name; version() may use md5 from CRAN.
- Use depends_on("pkg", type=("build", "run")) to scope dependency roles.
- Include non-C toolchains (rust/llvm) when upstream uses them.
- Use patch() + filter_file for simple text edits over external patch files.

    """Search Algorithms and Loss Functions for Bayesian Clustering

    The SALSO algorithm is an efficient randomized greedy search method to find a point estimate for a random partition based on a loss function and posterior Monte Carlo samples. The algorithm is implemented for many loss functions, including the Binder loss and a generalization of the variation of information loss, both of which allow for unequal weights on the two types of clustering mistakes. Efficient implementations are also provided for Monte Carlo estimation of the posterior expected loss of a given clustering estimate. See Dahl, Johnson, MÃ¼ller (2022) <doi:10.1080/10618600.2022.2069779>.
