    """Assorted Header-Only C++ Libraries.

    Vendors an assortment of useful header-only C++ libraries. Bioconductor
    packages can use these libraries in their own C++ code by LinkingTo this
    package without introducing any additional dependencies. The use of a central
    repository avoids duplicate vendoring of libraries across multiple R packages,
    and enables better coordination of version updates across cohorts of
    interdependent C++ libraries."""
