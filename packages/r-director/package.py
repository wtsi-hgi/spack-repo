class RDirector(RPackage):
	"""A dynamic visualization tool of multi-level data

	Director is an R package designed to streamline the visualization of molecular effects in regulatory cascades. It utilizes the R package htmltools and a modified Sankey plugin of the JavaScript library D3 to provide a fast and easy, browser-enabled solution to discovering potentially interesting downstream effects of regulatory and/or co-expressed molecules. The diagrams are robust, interactive, and packaged as highly-portable HTML files that eliminate the need for third-party software to view. This enables a straightforward approach for scientists to interpret the data produced, and bioinformatics developers an alternative means to present relevant data.
