class RIdpr(RPackage):
	"""Profiling and Analyzing Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in R

	‘idpr’ aims to integrate tools for the computational analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) within R. This package is used to identify known characteristics of IDPs for a sequence of interest with easily reported and dynamic results. Additionally, this package includes tools for IDP-based sequence analysis to be used in conjunction with other R packages. Described in McFadden WM & Yanowitz JL (2022). "idpr: A package for profiling and analyzing Intrinsically Disordered Proteins in R." PloS one, 17(4), e0266929. <https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0266929>.
