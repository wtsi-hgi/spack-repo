	"""Identification of domain isotypes in pfam data

	Protein domains is one of the most import annoation of proteins we have with the Pfam database/tool being (by far) the most used tool. This R package enables the user to read the pfam prediction from both webserver and stand-alone runs into R. We have recently shown most human protein domains exist as multiple distinct variants termed domain isotypes. Different domain isotypes are used in a cell, tissue, and disease-specific manner. Accordingly, we find that domain isotypes, compared to each other, modulate, or abolish the functionality of a protein domain. This R package enables the identification and classification of such domain isotypes from Pfam data.
