class RFlowgate(RPackage):
	"""Interactive Cytometry Gating in R

	flowGate adds an interactive Shiny app to allow manual GUI-based gating of flow cytometry data in R. Using flowGate, you can draw 1D and 2D span/rectangle gates, quadrant gates, and polygon gates on flow cytometry data by interactively drawing the gates on a plot of your data, rather than by specifying gate coordinates. This package is especially geared toward wet-lab cytometerists looking to take advantage of R for cytometry analysis, without necessarily having a lot of R experience.
