    """ssPATHS: Single Sample PATHway Score

    This package generates pathway scores from expression data for single samples after training on a reference cohort. The score is generated by taking the expression of a gene set (pathway) from a reference cohort and performing linear discriminant analysis to distinguish samples in the cohort that have the pathway augmented and not. The separating hyperplane is then used to score new samples.
