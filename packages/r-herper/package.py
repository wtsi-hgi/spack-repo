class RHerper(RPackage):
	"""The Herper package is a simple toolset to install and manage conda packages and environments from R

	Many tools for data analysis are not available in R, but are present in public repositories like conda. The Herper package provides a comprehensive set of functions to interact with the conda package managament system. With Herper users can install, manage and run conda packages from the comfort of their R session. Herper also provides an ad-hoc approach to handling external system requirements for R packages. For people developing packages with python conda dependencies we recommend using basilisk (https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/basilisk.html) to internally support these system requirments pre-hoc.
