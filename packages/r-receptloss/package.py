class RReceptloss(RPackage):
	"""Unsupervised Identification of Genes with Expression Loss in Subsets of Tumors

	receptLoss identifies genes whose expression is lost in subsets of tumors relative to normal tissue. It is particularly well-suited in cases where the number of normal tissue samples is small, as the distribution of gene expression in normal tissue samples is approximated by a Gaussian. Originally designed for identifying nuclear hormone receptor expression loss but can be applied transcriptome wide as well.
