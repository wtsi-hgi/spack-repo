	"""Microbiota STability ASsessment via Iterative cluStering

	The toolkit 'ÂµSTASIS', or microSTASIS, has been developed for the stability analysis of microbiota in a temporal framework by leveraging on iterative clustering. Concretely, the core function uses Hartigan-Wong k-means algorithm as many times as possible for stressing out paired samples from the same individuals to test if they remain together for multiple numbers of clusters over a whole data set of individuals. Moreover, the package includes multiple functions to subset samples from paired times, validate the results or visualize the output.
