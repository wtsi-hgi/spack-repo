feature now is soft-masking from left or right. This allows one to adjust
a SAM record only by changing the cigar string to soft-mask a number of bases
such that the rest of the SAM record (pos, tlen, etc.) remain valid, but
downstream tools will not consider the soft-masked bases in further analysis."""
