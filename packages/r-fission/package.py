	"""RangedSummarizedExperiment for time course RNA-Seq of fission yeast in response to stress, by Leong et al., Nat Commun 2014.

	This package provides a RangedSummarizedExperiment object of read counts in genes for a time course RNA-Seq experiment of fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe) in response to oxidative stress (1M sorbitol treatment) at 0, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 180 mins. The samples are further divided between a wild-type group and a group with deletion of atf21. The read count matrix was prepared and provided by the author of the study: Leong HS, Dawson K, Wirth C, Li Y, Connolly Y, Smith DL, Wilkinson CR, Miller CJ. "A global non-coding RNA system modulates fission yeast protein levels in response to stress". Nat Commun 2014 May 23;5:3947. PMID: 24853205. GEO: GSE56761.
