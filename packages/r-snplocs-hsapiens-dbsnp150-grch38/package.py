    SNP locations and alleles for Homo sapiens extracted from NCBI dbSNP Build 150. The source data files used for this package were created by NCBI between March 12-14, 2017, and contain SNPs mapped to reference genome GRCh38.p7 (a patched version of GRCh38 that doesn't alter chromosomes 1-22, X, Y, MT). Note that these SNPs can be "injected" in BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38 or in BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg38.
