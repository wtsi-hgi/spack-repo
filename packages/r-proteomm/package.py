class RProteomm(RPackage):
    """Multi-Dataset Model-based Differential Expression Proteomics Analysis Platform

    ProteoMM is a statistical method to perform model-based peptide-level differential expression analysis of single or multiple datasets. For multiple datasets ProteoMM produces a single fold change and p-value for each protein across multiple datasets. ProteoMM provides functionality for normalization, missing value imputation and differential expression. Model-based peptide-level imputation and differential expression analysis component of package follows the analysis described in â€œA statistical framework for protein quantitation in bottom-up MS based proteomics" (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009). EigenMS normalisation is implemented as described in "Normalization of peak intensities in bottom-up MS-based proteomics using singular value decomposition." (Karpievitch et al. Bioinformatics 2009).
