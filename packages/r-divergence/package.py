	"""Divergence: Functionality for assessing omics data by divergence with respect to a baseline

	This package provides functionality for performing divergence analysis as presented in Dinalankara et al, "Digitizing omics profiles by divergence from a baseline", PANS 2018. This allows the user to simplify high dimensional omics data into a binary or ternary format which encapsulates how the data is divergent from a specified baseline group with the same univariate or multivariate features.
