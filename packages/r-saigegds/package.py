	"""Scalable Implementation of Generalized mixed models using GDS files in Phenome-Wide Association Studies

	Scalable implementation of generalized mixed models with highly optimized C++ implementation and integration with Genomic Data Structure (GDS) files. It is designed for single variant tests and set-based aggregate tests in large-scale Phenome-wide Association Studies (PheWAS) with millions of variants and samples, controlling for sample structure and case-control imbalance. The implementation is based on the SAIGE R package (v0.45, Zhou et al. 2018 and Zhou et al. 2020), and it is extended to include the state-of-the-art ACAT-O set-based tests. Benchmarks show that SAIGEgds is significantly faster than the SAIGE R package.
