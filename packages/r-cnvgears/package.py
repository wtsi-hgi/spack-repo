    """A Framework of Functions to Combine, Analize and Interpret CNVs Calling Results

    This package contains a set of functions to perform several type of processing and analysis on CNVs calling pipelines/algorithms results in an integrated manner and regardless of the raw data type (SNPs array or NGS). It provides functions to combine multiple CNV calling results into a single object, filter them, compute CNVRs (CNV Regions) and inheritance patterns, detect genic load, and more. The package is best suited for studies in human family-based cohorts.
