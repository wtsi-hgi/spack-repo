	"""VeloViz: RNA-velocity informed 2D embeddings for visualizing cell state trajectories

	VeloViz uses each cellâ€™s current observed and predicted future transcriptional states inferred from RNA velocity analysis to build a nearest neighbor graph between cells in the population. Edges are then pruned based on a cosine correlation threshold and/or a distance threshold and the resulting graph is visualized using a force-directed graph layout algorithm. VeloViz can help ensure that relationships between cell states are reflected in the 2D embedding, allowing for more reliable representation of underlying cellular trajectories.
